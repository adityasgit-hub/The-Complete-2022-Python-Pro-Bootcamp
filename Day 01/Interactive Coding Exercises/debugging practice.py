#Fixed code

#missing quotation mark after the opening parenthesis.
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
#either convert the string's double-inverted commas to single-inverted commas or the plus operator's double-inverted commas to single-inverted commas.
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
#no identation required.
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
#double paranthesis after the word print.
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
